# Data_Visualization_Challenge
# Project Overview

This project analyzes the effectiveness of various drug regimens in reducing tumor growth in mice. Using a dataset containing information about tumor volumes, time points, mouse weights, and treatment types, we performed statistical analyses and generated visualizations to draw insights.

# Key Files

Data Files:

Mouse_metadata.csv: Contains metadata about each mouse, including its gender, age, and weight.

Study_results.csv: Contains study results, including tumor volume, metastatic sites, and time points.

Output:

Figures and tables generated during the analysis.

# Observations and Inferences

Capomulin and Ramicane Regimens Show Lower Tumor Volumes:

Box plots and summary statistics indicate that these two regimens are more effective at reducing tumor volumes compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.

Positive Correlation Between Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume:

A strong positive correlation (Ã¸ = 0.84) exists between mouse weight and tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen. Heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes.

Potential Outliers in Infubinol Regimen:

A potential outlier was detected in the Infubinol regimen, highlighting variability in its effectiveness.

# Visualizations and Analyses

Summary Statistics Table:

Calculated mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for tumor volumes across different drug regimens.

Bar Plot:

Showcased the number of time points observed for each treatment regimen.

Pie Chart:

Displayed the gender distribution of mice in the study.

Box Plot:

Highlighted the distribution of tumor volumes for each treatment group, identifying potential outliers.

Line Plot:

Visualized tumor volume over time for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.

Scatter Plot with Regression:

Analyzed the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen, including a regression line.
